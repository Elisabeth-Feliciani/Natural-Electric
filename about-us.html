                <br>
                Natural Electric is the brainchild of Adam Feliciani, an
                experienced and highly skilled electrician with a vision to create a company that would redefine
                excellence in electrical services. With a strong belief in the power of superior craftsmanship,
                integrity, and exceptional customer service, our founder embarked on a journey to establish a company
                that would surpass industry standards.
                <br>

                enterprise, serving a diverse range of clients across Caledon, York Region and the Greater Toronto Area. Despite our expansion, we have
                stayed true to our roots, maintaining the same dedication, attention to detail, and personal touch that
                set us apart from the competition.
